# Solving differential equations in R {.tabset}

In R, you can choose different ways to plot your data and results. By default, R ships with built-in graphical functions. Other functions, or entirely different paradigms, can be enabled using different packages. Here we give a brief overview of the standard plotting functions that are useful for quick data exploration. These are also referred to as R “base graphics” as no extra package is required.
