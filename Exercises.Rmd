## Getting started

You need to have the package *devtools* installed. If you haven't so you can do this with
```{r}

```

Please install the following R-package from my Github account:

```{r eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("clausrueffler/CodingWithR.exercises")
```

Next, you have to run
```{r eval=FALSE}
learnr::run_tutorial("lesson1", "tutorialpackage")
```
